		<h2> <i> <u> What is Systematic Theology? </u> </i> </h2>
			<p> Systematic theology is the <b> branch of theology that concerns specific topics </b>. What it does it make a <i>rational, organize, and coherent defense and explanation of the topic by systematically collecting ideas from different parts of the bible </i>. It is general-to-specific---a general topic dealt orderly by specific verses and chapters. This is one of the most important studies in theology, as it deals with the nature of God, His judgement, His laws, and many more. Starting with the revolutionary John Calvin (picture is seen below), this has grown into a very formal academia. Three of the many systematics, as they are called, shall be illustrated here. There are numerous systematics, and I simply can't illustrate them all. However, some of the most important, will be placed as examples. </p>

				<h2> <a href="https://bible.org/book/export/html/6349">Theology Proper</a> </h2>
				
					<p> This refers to the study of the <b> ontology of God </b>. Theology itself is the study of God; however, this is stil quite general since it can refer to the actions of God rather than His properties. Therefore, Theology proper is specifically the study of who God is. Some of the most important questions are:
					<ul type="circle">
						<li> <i> What are the characteristics of God? </li>
						<li> What does it mean to be "God" </li>
						<li> What does a trinity mean? </li>
						<li> How does he show His traits </i> </li>
					</ul>

				<h2> <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible-study/topical-studies/what-is-soteriology-and-why-is-it-essential-for-all-christians-to-know.html">Soteriology<a> </h2>
				
					<p> Soteriology is the study of <b> how does one get saved </b>. Soteriology comes from the word "salvation"; therefore, it refers to the process of this. Most of the studying of this systematic comes from the relationship of works and faith to salvation and how the bible can be systematically read to reoncile all its facts. Judgement all plays a big role in this systematic. The most important questions include:
					<ul type="circle">
						<li> <i> Who will God save? </li>
						<li> How does God save? </li>
						<li> Why does God save? </li>
						<li> Do I need faith or good works to be saved? </i> </li>
					</ul>

				<h2> <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Christology"> Christology  </a> </h2>
				
					<p> As the name suggests, this systematic is fully about <b> the study of Jesus Christ </b>. In this study, we go through the whole old testament to see the <i> early </i> descriptions and prophecies of Christ, and how he fulfilled and redefined them. We also look at the new testament at His characteristics, actions, importance, and future (eschatology). This is arguably the most important study in all of theology and probably the most researched. The most pressing questions are: 
					<ul type="circle">
						<li> <i> Who is Christ in the trinity </li>
						<li> How was Christ predicted </li>
							<li> What is the significance of Christ</li>
					<li> What shall he fulfill in the future </li>
						<li> What are the characteristics of Christ </i> </li>

					</ul>
